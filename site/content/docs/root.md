Authenticated Cloud Docs is a tool to publish secured content.  This documentation explains how to [edit content](Content%20Editing/ContentEditing) on an existing site, how to [customize](Site%20Customization/SiteCustomization) the appearance of a site, and how to get a site [set up](Site%20Setup/SiteSetup) if you don't have one already.

This site itself is an example of publishing using the tool.

Test content edit.

Please explore the site content using the Sidebar on the left.

:::note Editing content

At the bottom of each page is an _Edit this page_ link.  This link will bring you directly to the appropriate page in Github to make an edit (if you have access to the Github repository).
