There are multiple options for editing content, "technical" and "non-technical" users.  The main difference between the technical and non-technical approach is in the tools that are used to make the edits and preview changes.

All editing is done through changes to a Github repository.  This allows changes to be tracked in a version control system, which has many benefits.
